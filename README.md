## **Bank Churn prediction**
- Context:
Businesses like banks which provide service have to worry about problem of 'Customer Churn' i.e. customers leaving and joining another service provider. It is important to understand which aspects of the service influence a customer's decision in this regard. Management can concentrate efforts on improvement of service, keeping in mind these priorities.

- Objective:
Let us consider you are working as Data scientist with the bank and you need to build a neural network based classifier that can determine whether a customer will leave the bank or not in the next 6 months.

- Data Dictionary:
The case study is from an open-source dataset from Kaggle.The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features as follows:

CustomerId: Unique ID which is assigned to each customer

Surname: Last name of the customer

CreditScore: It defines the credit history of the customer.

Geography: A customerâ€™s location

Gender: It defines the Gender of the customer

Age: Age of the customer

Tenure: Number of years for which the customer has been with the bank

NumOfProducts: refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.

Balance: Account balance

HasCrCard: It is a categorical variable which decides whether the customer has credit card or not.

EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary

isActiveMember: Is is a categorical variable which decides whether the customer is active member of the bank or not ( Active member in the sense, using bank products regularly, making transactions etc )

Exited : whether or not the customer left the bank within six month. It can take two values

0=No ( Customer did not leave the bank ) 1=Yes ( Customer left the bank )
